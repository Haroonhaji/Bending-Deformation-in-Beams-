This is a basic Structural Engineering Program in python  that gives the bending moment diagram, shear force diagram, and deflection and slope of a beam subjected to multiple loadings.
Following are the types of beams which this program can solve :
a) Simply supported.  
b)Cantilevered.
c) Beam with an overhang.
Following are the types of loads that have been considered:
a) Concentrated load.
b) Uniformally distributed load.
c)Moment / torque.
